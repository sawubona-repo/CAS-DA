[^1]: Modern forms of commerce and sales support systems are designed to offer businesses a great potential for analyzing purchases. In the past sellers could draw conclusions concerning the sale on the basis of their own observations. Today’s supermarkets and hypermarkets generate so many transactions that managers’ intuition is insufficient. For example, the number of transactions in the U.S. WalMart chain reaches tens of millions per day1. The challenge is to use these huge databases in a way that would help to achieve a competitive advantage. One of the methods whose name often appears in the context of the analysis of shopping carts is data mining. From e-commerce point of view data mining models can be useful in2: attracting new visitors to the site, ensuring that the visitors will find the product they need and supporting the sales process.
